# MariaDB/MySQL

rAthena supports both MariaDB and MySQL, and the selection between these two database systems depends on various factors. While both databases are compatible with rAthena, differences exist that should be considered:

| Feature                   | MariaDB                              | MySQL                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Compatibility with rAthena** | Compatible                         | Compatible                            |
| **Performance**            | Generally faster, especially on complex queries; Additional storage engines (Aria, TokuDB, MyRocks) may provide advantages | Good performance; Performance may vary with storage engines and configurations |
| **Licensing**              | GPL v2            | GPL v2                    |
| **Replication**            | Galera Cluster for synchronous multi-master replication | MySQL Replication with semi-synchronous and asynchronous options |
| **Community & Support**    | Community-driven, with enterprise support from MariaDB Corporation | Developed by MySQL AB (now Oracle) with enterprise support available |

You can choose either MariaDB or MySQL based on your specific requirements, performance needs, and licensing considerations. Both databases should work well, it's up to you üê∏üëå
